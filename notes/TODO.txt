Step 1 - Make some pixels from C++ on screen
* Pick a PBR/graphics library
* Pick a GLTF parser
* Let N clients connect to one server
* Maybe switch to named pipes?

Candidates:
* vulkan-gltf-pbr by Sascha Willems
  . Uses Vulkan
  . Is more example app than library. Maybe that's good?

* Filament
  . Doesn't support rendering to texture
  . Doesn't support rendering from procedural texture (like web quads)
  . Mostly aimed at Android, apparently
  . Requires Clang to build
  . Uses lots of graphics back ends
  . Is an active project


* YoctoGL - https://github.com/xelatihy/yocto-gl
  . Uses OpenGL
  . Is an active project




Step 2 - Make some pixels from Javascript on screen
Step 3 - Make the pixels appear in a scene app
Step 4 - Make a quad from Javascript
Step 5 - Make input work back to Javascript/HTML/CSS
Step 6 - Make the pixels/input layer on top of other apps
