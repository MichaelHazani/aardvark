npm module for aardvark classes

make it work in release
figure out how to get command line options into the renderer. Maybe init it whena function is called?

========= DEAL WITH THIS NEXT ===========

* Fix dynamic reload of renderer tab. This should tear down the whole renderer and recreate it. Not having this is a pain when there are code changes on the Javascript side.

Will also need a gadget that's a list of potential gadgets, each of which is grabbable.


I'm sparning a gadget, but it's not attaching to itself to the grabber correctly. And I may be spawning more than one per grab.

At least one of the new objects is also having trouble with its texture.
