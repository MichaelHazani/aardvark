Current:
* Let N clients connect to one server -- seems to be working
* Upgrade vulkan SDK to the latest (1.1.something)
* Use the new core external memory stuff in 1.1 to pull in the shared DXGI handles from CEF. Example using older NV extensions here: https://developer.nvidia.com/getting-vulkan-ready-vr
* Make panel node type pick the model automatically
* Add a function to set DXGI handle for the panel
* some kind of default lighting that isn't blue
* Show frame info in the UI?
* Maybe switch to named pipes?
* Clients hanging up should clear apps/SGs (for now the renderer cleans up apps on the way out.)
