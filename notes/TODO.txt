Current:
* Show frame info in the UI?
* Maybe switch to named pipes?


Send these events to grabables:
* enter grabbing range
* leave grabbing range
* start grab
* grabbable moved
* release grab


collision processor
* inputs:
  - list of grabbables w/ transforms
  - list of grabbers w/ transforms
* outputs:
  - per grabber:
    > grab on/off
    > list of grabbables within range
      * transform from grabber to each grabbable?

grabber processor (per grabber)
* inputs:
  - grab on/off
  - list of grabables within range
* outputs:
  - possibly transform override nodes
  - events:
    > grab start/end/enter/leave to grabbable



app
	grab root <-- new origin?
		transform1
			handle1
		transform2
			handle2
		transforms, models, other stuff

========= DEAL WITH THIS NEXT ===========

Add grab* node types to scene graph
Add node handling to renderer
add collision processing in renderer
add volume function in "C" API and javascript
Add react components for grab* nodes
Update test app
Hook up grab state checking to collision
Hook start/end events up to notify renderer of new parentage (and add RPC for that)
implement default grabber



========= DEAL WITH THIS NEXT ===========



Step 1 - Make some pixels from C++ on screen (done)
Step 2 - Make the pixels appear in a scene app (done)
Step 3 - Make some pixels from Javascript (done)
Step 4 - Make a quad from Javascript (done)
Step 5 - Make input work back to Javascript/HTML/CSS
Step 6 - Haptics from panels (and pokers?)

Step 7 - Grabbables and grabbers

Step 50 - Make the pixels/input layer on top of other apps
