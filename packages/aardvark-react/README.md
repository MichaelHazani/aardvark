This package is a collection of React components that allow easy construction of gadgets that produce Aardvark scene graphs.

To get started, cd to an empty directory and type: 

	npm init @aardvarkxr

This will install the @aardvarkxr/create script and then run it. Answer the prompts to set up your gadget.

Then run:

  npm install
  npm run build

After that you probably want to install your gadget with: (You probably want "npm install -g avcmd" first.)

  avcmd install dist

You can open your gadget directory in Visual Studio Code to aid in react/aardvark development.
